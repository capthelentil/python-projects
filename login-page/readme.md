**Simple Login System**
This project is an attempt to bring to life the very first idea that came to my mind when I started programming: creating a login system. Below, you can find general information on how this project was created and how to use it.

**Project Description**
This project aims to create a simple login system that allows users to log in with a username and password. Users can register, and after that, they can log in. After logging in, the user's name will be displayed in a welcome message.

**Project Development**
There are several ways to further develop this project:

**Database Integration:** You can use a database to securely store user information.
**Security Enhancements:** You can improve system security by adding encryption or two-factor authentication.
**User Interface Enhancements:** You can add a graphical user interface to enhance the user experience.

**Contributing to the Project**
I'm open to any contributions! If you want to improve or fix bugs in this project, please submit a pull request.
